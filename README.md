### The Little Prince
My First attempt at coding a full game from scratch. This is a click based tile rotation game where there is a `prince` who keeps walking forward to occupy himself... Must be nice to have time to kill!
The goal of the game is to keep the `prince` inside the map AND avoid running into walls. Are you up for the challenge? Beware, as time goes, the `prince` becomes impatient and walks faster and faster. Can you keep up the pace, boy? 

#### Implemented feature: 
- Start up Screen
- Game Screen
- Game Over Screen
- Music 
- Random Tile generation and rotation (That was a time sink!)
- Increasing speed

#### "Nice-to-have" feature that I still might implement:
- [ ] Use the fruit and veggie assets as pick ups. Fruit are bonuses while veggies are disguting!
- [ ] Implement walking sprite for the main player
